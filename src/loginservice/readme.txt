We've all together tried to make this work as good as possible, but this is not functional 
watching countless tutorials and all. But we could not manage to bring it to work in
google cloud and let the microservices talk with each other. 
Close to the end we realized the scope was far to big and we were stuck in our tracks, 
as we are not strong enough in those technologies to make this service functional

We started a project and did not compelte it, but non-the-less we still learned a lot of
what to do and what not do to do when planning your own project.

# Kubernetes maze looms,
# Pods and nodes are all confused,
# Lost and helpless mind.
